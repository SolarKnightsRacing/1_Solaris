## Context and Problem Statement

#### ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA
>[**7. Vehicle Classes**](/Resources/ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA.pdf#page=24&selection=6,0,22,13)  
>Three (3) classes of solar vehicle will be recognized as part of the Event:
> * Single-Occupant
> * Multi-Occupant
> * Demonstration

We must choose which Vehicle Class to build. The regulations are slightly different for each class.

## Decision Drivers

* Simplicity: we are a new club and the visible progress that is getting a car on the road will boost morale, improve funding, and increase our credibility.
* Price: we do not have a lot of funding.

## Considered Options

* [Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV)](0001-Create-SOV-Class-Vehicle.md#Single-Occupancy-Vehicle-SOV)
* [Multiple Occupancy Vehicle (MOV)](0001-Create-SOV-Class-Vehicle.md#Multiple-Occupancy-Vehicle-MOV)
* [Demonstration (DEMO)](0001-Create-SOV-Class-Vehicle.md#Demonstration-DEMO)
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV)](0001-Create-SOV-Class-Vehicle.md#Single-Occupancy-Vehicle-SOV)", because it is the cheaper and simpler design to build.

### Consequences

* Good, because it is simple
* Good, because it is cheap
* Bad, because the inability to grid-charge places a lot of importance on the solar array

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV)

#### ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA
>[**7.1.A** Single-Occupant (SOV)](/Resources/ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA.pdf#page=24&selection=6,0,22,13)  
>This class comprises solar powered vehicles designed for a single-occupant. These vehicles are akin to the “Challenger” class of vehicles from the World Solar Challenge.  
* Good, because it is simple
* Good, because it is cheap
* Bad, because the inability to grid-charge places a lot of importance on the solar array

### Multiple Occupancy Vehicle (MOV)

#### ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA
>[**7.1.B Multi-Occupant (MOV)**](/Resources/ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA.pdf#page=24&selection=36,0,42,84)  
>This class comprises solar powered and grid-charge vehicles designed for multiple-occupants. These vehicles are akin to the “Cruiser” class of vehicles from the World Solar Challenge.  
* Good, because of the ability to grid-charge the vehicle
* Bad, because It is expensive
* Bad, because it is complex

### Demonstration (DEMO)

#### ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA
>[**7.1.C Demonstration (DEMO)**](/Resources/ASC2026_Regulations_RevisionA.pdf#page=24&selection=44,0,68,86)  
>**7.1.C.1** Vehicles in this class must have entered, passed Scrutineering, and qualified for ASC, FSGP or another recognized solar car event within four calendar years prior to the current Event, OR, they must be designed to released Regulations for an upcoming solar car event.  
>**7.1.C.2** At Scrutineering, vehicles in this class will be inspected to the Regulation set they were designed to and will be subject to additional regulations associated with safety from the Single-Occupant and Multi-Occupant class vehicle technical Regulations.  
> **7.1.C.3** This class is Demonstration only. Vehicles in this class will not be scored or ranked.

* Bad, because we do not have a vehicle that needs to be grandfathered in.
* Bad, because Vehicles in this class will not be scored or ranked.
