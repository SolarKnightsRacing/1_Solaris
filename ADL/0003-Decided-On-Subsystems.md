## Context and Problem Statement

Each component used and action taken to build the vehicle will be categorized into a subsystem in order to divide the work and responsibility amongst the team.
Which subsystems will we use?
## Decision Drivers

* All components and actions are covered and fit easily into subsystem categories.
* Avoid over-fitting categories to allow for flexibility.
* Consider other teams' organizational structure.

## Considered Options

* Vehicle Dynamics
* Chassis
* Electrical
* Ergonomics
* Aerodynamics
* Telemetry

## Decision Outcome

Chosen:
* Vehicle Dynamics
* Chassis
* Electrical
* Ergonomics

Not included:
* Aerodynamics
* Telemetry

### Consequences

* Good, because It does not over-fit the components or actions while still covering all of them
* Good, because it is similar to how successful teams organize their subsystems.
* Good, because it does not include Aerodynamics or telemetry. Neither of which will be focused on for our first vehicle because it is not worth the time nor money.
### Confirmation

Create directories in the Solaris repository corresponding to each subsystem.
